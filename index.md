### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorites because ut was the first one and it made me start understanding how to do code. Furthermore it wasn't too complex which made it easy to understand.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, was my second favorite because it was a lab that made me double check my knowledge of coding since I was trying to help my partner understand but I wasn't sure if I was explaining it well enough.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, is my Third and last favorite because The group I was put in made it fun to work on the code. Furthermore It wasn't too hard to do and we all learned the lab together.
